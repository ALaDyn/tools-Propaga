converter is a tool that I wrote to port data to/from Propaga, ALaDyn, Astra, Fluka, VTK, Path, ...
Other uses are its ability to analyse phase-space dumps, in order to calculate angles, energies and produce plots

dataproc is a tool that I use to extract useful parameters from the output of our programs, mainly from the MPI version of Propaga
